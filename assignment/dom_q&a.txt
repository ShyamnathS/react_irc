1.what is dom in js?

In JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. The document can be an HTML or XML document, and the DOM represents the structure of the document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, text content, etc.

The DOM provides a way for programs to manipulate the structure, style, and content of web documents. Using the DOM, JavaScript can dynamically update and change the content, structure, and style of a web page in response to user actions, events, or other factors.
